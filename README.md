This repository contains the necessary code for work done in the paper 'Rapid Prediction of Conformationally-Dependent DFT-Level Descriptors using Graph Neural Networks for Carboxylic Acids and Alkyl Amines' (ChemArxiv link)

The folder is organized as follows:

`get properties example/` contains scripts for obtaining descriptors from Gaussian calculations.

`2D/` contains necessary files for utilizing 2D models that were developed in this study. This folder also contians necessary code to implement training ot re-training of models for molecular, atom, bond properties. 

`3D` icontains necessary files for utilizing 3D models that were developed in this study. This folder also contians necessary code to implement training ot re-training of models for molecular, atom, bond properties. 

Each folder has a respective README.md which further documentation on utilising the code present within this repository.

Additional material related to this work can be found at [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25213742.v3) containing trained 2D & 3D models, datasets for training, results for test/external validation sets.
